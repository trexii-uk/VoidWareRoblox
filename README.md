# VoidWareRoblox
A fake Roblox executor. It has injection, that opens minimized command prompt, does tasklist and checks for RobloxPlayerBeta.exe. If it is not found running, an error will be given. If detected, options will appear. The only option that works, is Kill Roblox, as this is not a real cheat. It opens a minimized command prompt and does taskkill /f /im RobloxPlayerBeta.exe. Doing that will 'uninject' the executor. Don't hate me for the gui, I made the whole thing in like 30 minutes. If it gets flagged as a virus, allow it on your device, this is a false positive because it uses command prompt to fake inject and Kill Roblox. Don't get scared if your anti-virus flagged the exe as a trojan, it is 100% safe.
