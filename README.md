# VoidWareRoblox
A fake Roblox executor. It has injection, that opens minimized command prompt, does tasklist and checks for RobloxPlayerBeta.exe. If it is not found running, an error will be given. If detected, options will appear. The only option that works, is Kill Roblox, as this is not a real cheat. It opens a minimized command prompt and does taskkill /f /im RobloxPlayerBeta.exe. Doing that will 'uninject' the executor.
